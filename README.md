2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure Environment Variables:
```bash
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cyberguard
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
SESSION_TTL=86400
COOKIE_SECURE=false
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
